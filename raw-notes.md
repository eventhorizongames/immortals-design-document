# Immortals - Game Design Document

## Overview

Immortals is a game where you collect, train, and battle companions. The world contains special creatures called Immortals, all of these creatures have the special ability in that they cannot die.

When an Immortal reaches the end of it current life it will morph into an egg like stasis state. This state allows for the Immortal to never die, but also do not have any way to interact with the outside world.

The player can collect these eggs, not all eggs are the same though. An egg can have traits passed from their Charm's.

A Charm can be given to an Immortal, these give the Immortal a passive stat or a new Skill. The longer an Immortal holds a Charm the more that Charm will affect the Immortal Mold.

An Immortal's Mold affects it AI, this means they might attack more if they are attack focus or say next to their Player if focused on Defense. This Molding will also carry over to their egg state and can be further Melded in the future.
