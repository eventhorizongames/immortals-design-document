Immortals is a game where you collect, train, and battle companions. The world contains special creatures called Immortals, all of these creatures have the special ability in that they cannot die.

# Overall Vision for the Game

```
This section should provide a short summary or description of the game. Imagine you are ‘pitching’ the game to a friend while riding on an elevator. How would you describe the game in one minute or less? Why would they want to play it? What makes it sound fun and engaging?
```

The Player is on a simple mission, beat all the Royalty in the world around his village. The village has fallen on troubled times and the Player has the chance to help their village by defeating the Royalty and getting the renown to help their village.

As Royals are defeated their village will transform, as more renown is directed to the village.

The Player does not battle, they are the King to be protected, the Immortals are how the Player battles.

Immortals is a game where you collect, train, and battle with your companions. The world contains special creatures called Immortals, all of these creatures have the special ability in that they cannot die.

When an Immortal reaches the end of it current life it will morph into an egg like stasis state. This state allows for the Immortal to never die, but also do not have any way to interact with the outside world.

The player can collect these eggs, not all eggs are the same though. An egg can have traits passed from their Charm's.

A Charm can be given to an Immortal, these give the Immortal a passive stat or a new Skill. The longer an Immortal holds a Charm the more that Charm will affect the Immortal Mold.

An Immortal's Mold affects it AI, this means they might attack more if they are attack focus or say next to their Player if focused on Defense. This Molding will also carry over to their egg state and can be further Melded in the future.

# Target Audience

```
Great game designers always design their games with a specific audience in mind, and this section should describe that audience. For example, are you designing your game for young kids, older kids, or adults? Boys, girls, or both? Is the game designed for hard-core players who like deep, highly challenging games or casual players who like to play a little bit each day?
```

Collector, Min/max players. They want to collect the different types of Immortals. And max out the Immortal with charms to create the best of the best companion for battle.

# Platform

```
Is the game designed to be played on a game console? A mobile device? The web? A good game design targets a specific platform and uses the capabilities of that platform to its advantage. Doing a 3D first person action game in a web browser is hard (but not impossible!), and you can’t count on your players having access to a joystick if they’re going to be playing on a smartphone.
```

Web based. ElectronJS for Client, or any browser.

# Genre

```
This section should describe the genre of the game. Popular genres include action, adventure, sports, strategy, puzzle, racing, platformer, and role-playing. Is the game a mix of genres (e.g. action-adventure or a clever combination that’s never been tried before)? Or maybe you have created an entirely new genre!
```

Action, Role-playing, strategy.

# Core Game-play

```
This section should describe in detail what playing the game is like. Most game design documents will do this by talking about some or all of the following things:
```

## Core game mechanics:

```
What is the player doing in the game? This is often best described through active verbs like running, jumping, racing, counting, puzzle solving, or exploring. Is the game single player or multiplayer? Cooperative or competitive?
```

Every player has their own Village, this make it unique to them. Going back to the village they can see the Trophies from their Adventures.

## Goals:

```
What is the player trying to accomplish in the game (i.e. what is the ‘win state’)? What does he or she have to do to achieve that goal? What barriers or obstacles exist that make achieving that goal difficult? How can the player fail at achieving the goal(s) (i.e. ‘loss states’)? What kind of feedback does the player get on progress towards the goal? How is the player rewarded when a goal is achieved?
```

Bring renown to their home village.
Defeating all Royalty of the World.
Collecting all Immortal Types.
Collecting all Charm types.

## Components:

```
What kinds of things are there in the game? For example, enemies, objects in the environment, power-ups, points, etc. What do they look like? What do they do? How can the player interact with them?
```

The player will combat other Immortals in the work with their Immortal Companions. They will collect more Immortals, use Charms to Mold their companion. Charms drop from defeated companions. Charms come in a variety of different types; attack, defense, passive are the main types. But come in in the different affects they have.

Immortal are blank slate companions, adding charms are used to enhance them.

A Charm can be a new skill for the Immortal, a boost to a certain type of elemental type, expand the area of effect of skills. These Charms will also change the look of the Immortal.

## Controls:

```
How does the player control what happens in the game? What does pushing a certain button on the controller do? Can the player move a block by touching the screen and dragging it?
```

WASD Player movement.
Mouse/Touch companion movement.

## User experience:

```
When the player starts to play the game, what steps do they follow? What screens will they see? How are levels in the game structured? How does the player move from one part of the game to the next?
```

Overhead view of the player and his immortals in the world.

# Visual Style

```
This section should describe the look and feel of the game. Where does the game take place: In the real world? A fantasy world? Space? Underground? In the past? In the future? Is the game a 2D world? A 3D World? What does the art look and feel like: Is it gritty and realistic, beautiful and fantastical or something else? Many GDD’s include drawings or graphics to illustrate the visual concept.
```

3D Medieval Fantasy.
